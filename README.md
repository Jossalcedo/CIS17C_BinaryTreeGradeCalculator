# CIS17C_BinaryTreeGradeCalculator
The Binary Tree in this program is implemented as a Binary Search Tree. 
I implemented a loop in the program that allows the user to enter however many variables (test scores) they decide to put 
in to calculate their average. When they are inputting their scores, they are actually inserting them into the Binary Search Tree. 

For the calculations of the test scores, what the program does is that once the tree has its values, it has a function that will sum 
all of the elements in the tree, and one that will search the tree for the minimum value. Once we have these values, they are 
subtracted and then divided by the number of test scores the user put in.

To run, Copy and paste code into an online compliler.
